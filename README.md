## The French Web Scrapper

This is a short php script that I wrote to scrap the french letters and sounds from https://www.rocketlanguages.com/french/lessons/french-alphabet in order to get the data that I needed to work on a mobile application to make it easy to learn french

## Get started
- Clone the repo 
- Run composer install to install the vendor packages
- Run php artisan scrape_french_info to get run the script to get data from the website
